Installing and Configuring a Build Agent

    Installing a build agent follows a very similar process to the Continuum master installation.

    First, {{{http://continuum.apache.org/download.html}download}} the Continuum Build Agent standalone
    distribution or web application.

    <<Note>>: It is recommended to use Build Agents that come with the release of Continuum (Continuum Master) to be
    used. While 1.3.x Build Agents can be used with 1.4.x Continuum (Continuum Master), using a later version of Build
    Agent than the Continuum (Continuum Master) will not work.

* Standalone

    The Build Agent is available as a separate standalone Jetty-bundled
    application.  Installing it is as simple as extracting it to a preferred
    directory.

    The Build Agent runs on a specific port (defaulting to 8181), so it is possible
    to install multiple Build Agents in one machine.  It is also possible to
    install Build Agents in the same machine as the Master.  To configure the Build Agent
    to run using a different port, edit the
    <<<$CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME/conf/jetty.xml>>> file.

    Another configuration file to look at is the
    <<<$CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME/conf/continuum-buildagent.xml>>>.  This file must
    be manually edited, as there is no web interface for this configuration.

+--------------+
<continuum-buildagent-configuration>
  <buildOutputDirectory>/path/to/build/agent/data/build-output-directory</buildOutputDirectory>
  <workingDirectory>/path/to/build/agent/data/working-directory</workingDirectory>
  <continuumServerUrl>http://builds.example.com:8080/continuum/master-xmlrpc</continuumServerUrl>
  <installations>
    <installation>
      <name>Maven Home</name>
      <type>maven2</type>
      <varValue>/Applications/apache-maven-2.0.9</varValue>
    </installation>
  </installations>
  <localRepositories>
    <localRepository>
      <name>default</name>
      <location>/home/user/.m2/repository</location>
      <layout>default</layout>
    </localRepository>
  </localRepositories>
  <sharedSecretPassword>PSK</sharedSecretPassword>
</continuum-buildagent-configuration>
+----------------+

    The configuration will have the following fields:

      * <<<continuumServerUrl>>> - the URL pointing to the XML-RPC context of the Continuum Master

      * <<<sharedSecretPassword>>> - the pre-shared key (PSK) between master and agent. Copy the PSK that was configured
        in the Continuum Master configuration file <<<continuum.xml>>> (or corresponding web interface field).

      * <<<buildOutputDirectory>>> - similar to the build output directory of Continuum.

      * <<<workingDirectory>>> - similar to the working directory of Continuum

      * <<<installations>>> - an optional list of the installations available on the Build Agent, including Maven, Ant,
        JDK, etc.
    
      * <<<localRepositories>>> - an optional list of the local repositories that will be used by the build agent when
        building and releasing projects. The local repository <<<name>>> must match that of the local repository
        configured in the Continuum Master. This configuration is only available in Continuum 1.4.0+.

  Note that all of your agents need not be identical, as there is a way to control which agent Continuum chooses by
  using a {{{../administrator_guides/build-agent-groups.html}Build Agent Group}}. In addition, you need to
  {{{../administrator_guides/buildEnvironment.html} configure}} the Build Environment from the Master in order to
  specify which installation to use for the build.

  Now start the Build Agent by executing the startup script available in
  <<<$CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME/bin/>>>.  For example:

+---+
continuum-buildagent start
+---+

  or if you are on Windows

+---+
continuum-buildagent.bat console
+---+

  Next, {{{../administrator_guides/build-agents.html}add the agent}} to the Continuum Master server. 

  Note that agent will be automatically disabled if the PSK is not configured properly or if the agent is unreachable by
  the Continuum Master.

  To conclude the installation, you should set it up as a service, following the same instructions as those shown for
  Continuum for {{{./standalone.html#Installing_as_a_Windows_Service} Windows}} or
  {{{./standalone.html#Installing_as_a_Linux_Service} Linux}}.

* Web Application

  The Build Agent is also available as a web application which you can install into your own container. Unlike Continuum
  itself, you do not need to configure Mail and Databases, so the deployment is much simpler.

  The Build Agent needs the following in order to function properly:

    [[1]] a <<<appserver.base>>> system property

    [[2]] a <<<continuum-buildagent.xml>>> configuration file in <<<$\{appserver.base\}/conf>>>

    [[3]] a working area with <<<logs>>> and <<<temp>>> directories

  Set the system property using the recommended method for your application server. An example for Tomcat is shown in
  the {{{./tomcat.html#Configure_the_appserver.base_Java_system_property} same instructions as those shown for Continuum}}.

  Next, create the <<<continuum-buildagent.xml>>> file as shown in the Standalone section above, and save it in
  <<<$\{appserver.base\}/conf>>>. You will need to create these directories, as well as <<<$\{appserver.base\}/logs>>>
  and <<<$\{appserver.base\}/temp>>>.

  Finally, drop the web application into your container, and start it.

* {Installing with Puppet}

  As with Continuum, if you use Puppet to manage your infrastructure, and wish to install the standalone build agent,
  you can use a third-party Puppet module.
