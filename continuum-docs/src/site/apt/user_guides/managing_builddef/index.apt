Managing Build Definitions

    Each project or project group must have at least one attached build definition in order to build.
    
    Depending on the project, you can define different values which will be used in order to build your project.
    
    Continuum includes some default build definitions which can be changed in the <<{{{../../administrator_guides/builddefTemplate.html}Build Definition Templates screen}}>>.
    
    You can add or edit build definitions at the <<{{{builddefGroup.html}Project Group level}}>> or at the <<{{{builddefProject.html}Project level}}>>.
