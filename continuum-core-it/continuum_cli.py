# Build your commands in this class.  Each method that
# starts with "do_" is exposed as a shell command, and
# its doc string is used when the user types 'help' or
# 'man'.  A command that does not return None, will
# cause the shell to terminate.
#
# The first line of the docstring is used when help is
# typed by itself to give a summary, and then if the
# user requests specific help on a command, the full
# text is supplied.
#
# If your system has the GNU readline stuff on it, then
# pressing tab will do tab completion of the commands.
# You will also get much nicer command line editing
# just like using your shell, as well as command
# history.
