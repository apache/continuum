o i would like to be able to develop components and have the application
  pick them up from their target directory. so artifact enable the app server
  and teach it about the unified source directory.
  
  right now i have a little script that creates the necessary symlinks to the
  appropriate directories but it would be nice to have something a little more
  elegant then that. couple that with some dynamic JAR reloading and that
  would make development much quicker.
