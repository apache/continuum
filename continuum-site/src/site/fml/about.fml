      <question>What is "Continuous Integration"?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The term "continuous integration" refers to a process that builds and tests code on a frequent, regular
          basis.  Many continuous integration systems monitor a source repository at regular intervals and trigger an
          "integration" every time someone commits a change.  An "integration" can be anything from compiling and testing a single
          project to the assembly and testing of a deliverable from multiple dependent projects.  Among the benefits of continuous integration
          are the immediate identification of defects and the ability to guarantee that a project's build will succeed at any
          point in the development cycle.
        </p>

          An in-depth description of continuous integration is beyond the scope of this FAQ. A much more detailed explanation of the concept can be 
          found at the resources listed below:

      <question>How do I write documentation for Continuum?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Good documentation is essential, and any help would be appreciated. If you would like to help create
          documentation for the Continuum project, check out the Continuum site project from the ASF Subversion
          repository and submit patches using Codehaus' JIRA installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To checkout the continuum-site project from the ASF Subversion repository, download the Subversion client for
          your platform and run:
          <source>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/continuum/trunk/continuum-site
          </source>
        </p>
        <p>
          To build the continuum-site project you will need to use Maven 2.  You can download Maven 2 from the <a 
          href="http://maven.apache.org/maven2/download.html">Downloads page on the Maven 2 project site</a>.  Once you
          have installed Maven 2 and added it to your <code>PATH</code>, you can build the Continuum project site by
          executing the <code>site:site</code> goal with the following command:
          <source>
mvn site:site
          </source>
          After executing the <code>site:site</code> goal, the Continuum site will be stored in the
          <code>target/site</code> directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you receive an error resolving the artifact <code>continuum-parent</code>, download the parent pom.xml from <a 
          href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/continuum/trunk/pom.xml">here</a> and place it in the directory above your
          <code>continuum-site</code> directory.  Then try the build again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have updated the documentation, generate a patch by running
          <source>
svn diff > site-patch.txt
          </source>
          Create a
          new issue in the Continuum JIRA project, and attach your patch to this issue.  Before submitting the patch, make sure
          to build the Continuum site locally and proofread for any typos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If you haven't already read <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html">How to Help</a>, you should.
