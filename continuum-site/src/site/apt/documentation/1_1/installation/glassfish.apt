    Sections:

%{toc|section=0}

* {Datasource Configuration}

    * Create a connection pool naled '<<continuum>>' for your database

    * Create a JDBC resource named '<<jdbc/continuum>>'linked to the '<<continuum>' connection pool

    * Create a JDBC resource named '<<jdbc/users>>'linked to the '<<continuum>' connection pool

* {Install Continuum}

    To Install Continuum, you'll need the Continuum war.

    Look at {{{https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/quickstart/index.html#ProcedureTo_Deploy_From_the_Admin}Procedure To Deploy From the Admin Console}} in GlassFish.

* {Continuum Configuration}

    By default, the '<<<working directory>>>' and the '<<<build output directory>>>' are stored under the WEB-INF directory. If you want to change them (necessary on Windows
    due to the path length limitation), you can configure them in the {{{../administrator_guides/configuration.html}Configuration page}}.
