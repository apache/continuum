Getting the sources

 To get the sources from the Subversion repository use this SVN url:
 <<<http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/continuum/tags/continuum-alpha-1>>>

 If you are using the <<<svn>>> command line Subversion client you can check out the sources with this command:

+--+
$ svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/continuum/tags/continuum-alpha-1/ continuum
+--+

 All the Continuum Alpha 1 sources will be in a directory called <<<continuum>>>.

 For more information on how to check out the sources see the information pages from Apache
 {{{http://apache.org/dev/version-control.html}here}}.

Building Continuum

 <<NOTE:>> Continuum requires Maven 2 alpha 2 to build.

 Continuum consists of 6 Maven 2 projects:

 [continuum-model] is the object model that continuum uses.

 [continuum-core] is Continuum's core. It contains all the code for checking out and building the projects. It also
                  contains the mail notifier and socket listeners.

 [continuum-web] is the web interface for Continuum. It contains the form definitions used in the web application
                 and internationalization strings.

 [continuum-xmlrpc] is the XML-RPC interface. It contains a single component that maps the XML-RPC method calls
                    to the core components.

 [continuum-plexus-application] is a special project that mainly contains the configuration files for Plexus when
                                running Continuum as a Plexus application.

 [continuum-core-it] is a integration tests written in Python. It uses the XML-RPC interface to communicate with
                     the Continuum instance.

 []

 The easiest way to build the entire Continuum project is to use the shell script from the root of the check out like this:
 
+--+
$ sh build.sh</source>
+--+
