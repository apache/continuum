o deploy/release all components i've modified
  - plexus-i18n
  - plexus-action
  - plexus-formica
  - plexus-formica-web
  - plexus-summit  

o need to check if a project already exists

o check out the release documentation, it would be good to tell users what
  they need to be installed in order to use the various builders

x hookup scm validator
x trigger the build from the summary
x i18n the delete message
x test update
x need the content generator to be used in the view
x separate add form for m1/m2 from the display and update
  the add form should have the POM and goals/phase
x formica needs to be able to call methods with parameters instead of using
  a target object

      add  / update / view / delete
-----------------------------------
m1    ok     ok       ok     ok
-----------------------------------
m2    ok     ok       ok     ok
-----------------------------------
ant   ok     ok       ok     ok
-----------------------------------
shell ok     ok       ok     ok
-----------------------------------

NOTE: delete only works when projects are added via the
web interface. projects added to the continuum via xmlrpc
can't be deleted.

o fix the layout selection so that the menu doesn't show up in the login

o need a way in summit to map an url to a page + any parameters required:
  i want to set the default page to continuumProject.form?mode=summary, but
  you can't set a target with parameters.

o properties files for localization are horrible in order to easily
  make language packs we need a tool to help show the keys for the target
  language that need values.

o move the configuration of summit into the webapp components.xml so that I 
  can control the default view and error page better
  
o stackable validators

o for complex validations like the scm validator we may want a better error
  out put mechanism. or at least make the error output configurable because
  lots of things could be wrong. need to return a i18n key for the given 
  error message. this is the only way that you can get a meaningful message
  back from validation. One per validator doesn't cut it.

o need to make a paging mechanism, things like the number of builds adds
  up pretty quickly.

o start/stop scripts and supervise integration

o debug mode that spits out sample urls to use for testing

o whip up some quick tests using maxq
